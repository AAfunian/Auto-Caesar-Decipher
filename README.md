# Auto-Caesar-Decipher

The user enters in an english sentence, followed by the number of letters in the alphabet which they would like to caesar shift their sentence by.
The caesar shifted sentence is then automatically deciphered by the program using a frequency table.
## Purpose:
The code can be thought of or separated into two purposes: to caesar shift your own input as a simple method of encryption, or to decipher a message which has been encrypted using a caesar cipher.
